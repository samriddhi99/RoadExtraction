Automatic Road Extraction and alert generation for new roads

The continuous and accurate mapping of road infrastructure is critical not only for urban development and planning but also for national security,
especially in sensitive border regions. In many cases, adversaries may construct roads or temporary pathways in remote or disputed areas to facilitate
unauthorized access, logistics movement, or military mobilization, often going unnoticed until significant activity has already taken place. 

This project aims to develop an automated system for road extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery, leveraging deep learning techniques.
The system will not only detect and map existing roads but also generate alerts for new road constructions, with special focus on strategic border areas.
By comparing historical and recent satellite images, it will flag regions showing signs of new roads or pathways and present them via an intuitive interface 
for validation and further action by authorities.
